                        I grow a lot of my own herbs and make plant medicine (think elderberry syrup)
                        for friends & various mutual aid projects.

                    <li>
                        In the past, I've worked at a vegetable farm, a public library, and
                        an astrophysics lab. Perhaps more surprisingly, I enjoyed all three!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I'm originally from Oregon, but I've lived in every major bioregion of the continental US except for the Southwest. Maybe sometime soon?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I read critical theory for fun, much to the chagrin of those around me.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have two cats! One is a grumpy old man and the other is a tiny baby demon. They bond over their shared love of begging for food, which I am trying to condition them out of. . . .ask me how it's going?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I am trained in classical ballet and classical choral music, and love to dance and sing.
